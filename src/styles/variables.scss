/**
  * "You may notice that there is no xl property on the breakpoint service, this is intentional.
  *  Viewport calculations always start at 0 and work their way up.
  *  A value of 340 for the xs threshold means that a window size of 0 to 340 is considered to be an extra small screen.
  *  To propagate these changes to css helper classes we need to update the $grid-breakpoints SASS variable with our new values.
  *  On large and extra-large screens we subtract width of the browserâ€™s scrollbar from the defined breakpoints."
