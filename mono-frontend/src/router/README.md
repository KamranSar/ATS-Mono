In the templates `/router` folder, you'll find 2 files.

`index.js` - This is the file that gets created when we do an `vue add router`
`routes.js` - This file is a simple extraction of all the routes that gets pulled in by `index.js`

- - This file **ONLY** holds the application specific routers, `/login, /home,...` are provided by default in `local_modules/vue-frontend/router/`
